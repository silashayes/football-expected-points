# Football Expected Points Simulation
- Calculates the expected points of a given situation (down, yards to go, yardage) by simulating football plays
- Sampling of plays comes from a mixture model that models the number of yards gained on a play in a given situation
- Model is parameterized so can be adjusted to perform analysis
- In this case, difference in expected value when running/passing rate increased by a small percentage was analyzed
- Additionally, the value (i.e. difference in expected points) of a good punter over an average punter analyzed
